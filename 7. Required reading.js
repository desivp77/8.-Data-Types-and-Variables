// Write a function to help Ivan calculate how many hours a day he has to spend reading the necessary literature from the list given for the summer vacation.
// As input, you will receive 3 parameters: 
// •	Number of pages of the current book - integer [1… 1000] 
// •	Pages read in 1 hour - integer [1… 1000]
// •	The number of days for which you must read the book -  integer [1… 1000]
// As output print on the console the number of hours, that Ivan has to read each day.

// Total time to read the book: 212 pages / 20 pages per hour = 10.6 hours
// Required hours per day: 10.6 hours / 2 days = 5.3 hours per day 


function books(totalPages, pagesPerHour, daysToRead){
let timeToRead = totalPages / pagesPerHour;

finalRead = timeToRead / daysToRead;
console.log(finalRead);

}

books(212, 20, 2); 
books(432, 15, 4);
